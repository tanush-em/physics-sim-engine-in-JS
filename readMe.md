# Physics Simulation Engine in JavaScript

A lightweight physics simulation engine implemented in JavaScript that handles various physics calculations and interactions including collision detection, air drag effects, and rigid body dynamics.

## Features

- **Collision Simulation**
  - Accurate collision detection and response
  - Support for multiple object interactions
  - Elastic and inelastic collision handling

- **Bounce Impact with Air Drag**
  - Realistic bounce physics
  - Air resistance simulation
  - Variable drag coefficient support

- **Suspension of Rigid Body**
  - Rigid body dynamics
  - Spring-mass damper system
  - Customizable suspension parameters`
